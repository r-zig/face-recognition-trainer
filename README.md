# Face Recognition Trainer and Evaluator
This project provides a powerful tool for training and evaluating face recognition systems. It offers the following key features:

## Folder Scanning:
Recursively scans directories, including all subfolders, to gather images for training and evaluation.
## API Integration:
Integrates with multiple face recognition systems via API calls to automate the training process.
## Result Measurement:
Measures the accuracy and effectiveness of the face recognition models after training, providing valuable insights for further tuning.

Whether you're developing a new face recognition model or improving an existing one, this tool streamlines the process by handling the heavy lifting of data preparation, training, and evaluation.
